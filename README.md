# Arch Linux ARM for Pine64

This repository contains PKGBUILDs for running ALARM on the Pine64 devices (currently only Pinetab and PinePhone is supported).
You can compile the packages using a native ARM64 system (such as RockPro64 or a RPi4, any should work), otherwise if you don't have ARM64 boards, you can set up a QEMU chroot on your x86_64 system (slower).

Compiled PKGBUILDs and rootfs images can be found in "Releases"
