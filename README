Arch Linux ARM for Pinetab

This repository contains PKGBUILDs for running ALARM on the prototype Pinetab.
You can compile the packages using a native ARM64 system (such as RockPro64 or a RPi4, any should work), otherwise if you don't have ARM64 boards, you can set up a QEMU chroot on your x86_64 system (slower).

Compiled PKGBUILDs and rootfs images can be found in "Releases"

mesa-git package contains panfrost, so this also can be used on the Pinebook Pro.
